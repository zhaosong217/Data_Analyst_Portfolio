**Methodology:** SQL Data Exploration + Tableau Visualization
**Objective:** Identify high-demand skills and top-paying positions in the data job market

**Key Research Questions Explored**
- Market Overview
  - Total job postings and unique companies
  - Distribution of job schedules (remote, hybrid, in-office)
  - Posting frequency by month/platform to identify hiring trends
- Compensation Analysis
  - Positions with highest average yearly salaries
  - Salary variations across job categories
- Skill Demand Mapping
  - Most frequently required skills by position
  - Emerging skill trends in data-related roles

**SQL Techniques Applied**
|Category|Specific Skills Demonstrated|
|--------|--------|
|Query Fundamentals|SELECT, DISTINCT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY|
|Conditional Logic|Comparison operators, LIKE with wildcards, HAVING|
|Data Aggregation|COUNT(), AVG(), SUM(), MAX()/MIN()|
|Table Relationships|INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN|
|Advanced Querying|Subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs)|
|Analytical Functions|Window functions (ROW_NUMBER())|
|Data Transformation|CASE statements for conditional categorization|

**Visualization Approach**
- Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to:
  - Compare salary distributions across job titles
  - Track monthly posting trends via animated time-series
  - Generate skill heatmaps for different positions
- Implemented cross-filtering for dynamic exploration
**Tableau Techniques Applied**
